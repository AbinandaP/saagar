1.Execute creationX_Y for creating table X_Y
2.Execute creatinmaintable for the creation of table maintable.
3.Execute database for the functions to be ready.
4.Execute imageget to capture the image of the rust sample object.
5.Execute Project to get the rusted pixels so that the coordinates are obtained.

This project's aim is to rust detection. We have OpenCV for getting the live feed of the rust sample object and then get the pixels that are rusted using the numpy 
package. Corrosion is the biggest problem in the field of Automotive Industry. This project has a lot of scope in the Industry for detecting the rust.
