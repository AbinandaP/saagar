RUST DETCTION USING OPENCV PYTHON(RESULT:PIXEL POINTS GENERATED)

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

Corrosion is a widely encountered issue in the automotive industry. To account for and prevent this problem, industry leaders often run experiments to test the corrosion resistance of vehicles. Rust detection program using OpenCV python has a lot of scope in solving this problem.
Using this program the manufacturing machines in the Automotive Sector can easily get to know the rust pixel points and then do the needful in repairing it.

PATH IN RUNNING THE PROJECT CODE:

1.Execute creationX_Y for creating table X_Y
2.Execute creatinmaintable for the creation of table maintable.
3.Execute database for the functions to be ready.
4.Execute imageget to capture the image of the rust sample object.
5.Execute Project to get the rusted pixels so that the coordinates are obtained.
